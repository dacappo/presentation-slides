# Personal reveal.js template

This extended reveal.js fork serves as the basis for my presentations. For official reveal.js documentation see [repository](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#markup).

## Creating a new presentation

Fork this repository and add content slides. Updates of reveal.js can be accomplished by rebasing the actual presentation repositories with this base template.
